# iPhonePorts build system

> Build scripts for the packages at http://cydia.uniq.gay/

## Setup

You will need an up-to-date iPhonePorts toolchain to use the build scripts in this repo, you can build one with https://github.com/Un1q32/iphoneports-toolchain-builder.

## Usage

```
Usage: build.sh [options] <command>
    <pkg> [pkgs...]         - Build specified packages
    build <pkg> [pkgs...]   - Build specified packages
    all [pkgs...]           - Build all packages (except those specified)
    all-noclean [pkgs...]   - Same as all but doesn't cleanall first
    clean <pkg> [pkgs...]   - Clean a single package
    cleanall                - Clean all packages
    dryrun [pkgs...]        - Pretend to build all packages, for debugging
    abibreak <pkg>          - ABI break helper, opens all the control files for packages
                              that depend on <pkg> and then rebuilds them
    sysroot <pkg> [pkgs...] - Copy specified package's files and dependencies to sysroot directory

    --no-tmp                - Do not use /tmp for anything, use the current directory instead
    -jN                     - Set the number of jobs passed to programs like make and ninja
